# My Model 01 Customizations

My customizations for the firmware of the Keyboardio Model 01 keyboard.

I plan to very heavily cater to my own very specific needs here, but I may
also use this as the starting location to useful functionality that will
eventually be spun into standalone plugins useful to the larger community.

There are a couple unobvious factors that have led to some of the decisions made herein:

  * While I believe that the caps lock key is useful and has its place, I don't
  believe it needs to be easily reached. I am not using my caps lock key as a
  caps lock. I use a Windows utility called
  [WinCompose](https://github.com/SamHocevar/wincompose) with my caps lock key
  set to act as a [compose key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compose_key).
  Caps lock is toggled by pressing both shift keys together. I'd set it to
  something more obscure, but I will still occasionally be using a normal
  keyboard.

  * I have no qualms against very heavy modification of my keyboard, but I've
  already done that in the past before receiving my Model01. While I'm not using
  the same modifications (e.g. having a numpad under my right home row removes
  any need to mess around with number row placement) those modifications have
  informed my layout on this keyboard.

  * I'm a heavy Vim user. It's one of many applications that will likely inform
  what I do with my layouts and modes. Vim in particular will heavily inform
  the default layer/mode. Other applications, like games such as Dwarf
  Fortress, will inform other modes or even receive dedicated modes.

  * The LEDs weren't a big part of why I bought the Model01. When I first began
  looking into getting one, I emailed Keyboardio about the possibility of saving
  costs by omitting them. They answered that they only add something like $10 to
  the total cost, so you may as well at this price point. I completely agree.
  One of the things I had at first wished the Model01 had was an LCD screen,
  like the Ergodox Infinity, but I realized individually addressable lights
  under each key could actually be more informative, and that more fluently.
  This is all to say that I have a more utilitarian view of how the lights
  should be used. I'll still leave in some eye-candy color modes for showing the
  device off, though.
