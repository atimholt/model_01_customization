# My Model 01 Customizations

My customizations for the firmware of the Keyboardio Model 01 keyboard.

I plan to very heavily cater to my own very specific needs here, but I may
also use this as the starting location to useful functionality that will
eventually be spun into standalone plugins useful to the larger community.

This project can be compiled and used using [the instructions found here](https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope/wiki/Install-Arduino-support-on-Windows)
([Linux](https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope/wiki/Install-Arduino-support-on-Linux), [Mac](https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope/wiki/Install-Arduino-support-on-a-Mac)).
